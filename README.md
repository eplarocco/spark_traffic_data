# spark_traffic_data
Final project for distributed computing course

# To Do / Ideas:
### Eileanor:
- clean up weather conditions (group into smaller columns) - Eileanor
- add day of the week or month/season or holiday column - Eileanor
- add rush hour column (find definition of rush hour) - Eileanor

### Layla:
- use zipcode to engineer additional features (economic status and density) but don't use zipcode (large categorical variable) - Layla
- add columns for highway/not highway - Layla

### Kaleigh:
- modeling prep
- predict severity as continuous variable
- ensure sampling evenly by category for training

### Later:
- choose astromonical twilight (actual dark) or sunrise_sunset
- remove turning loop and country as have all same values
- remove roundabout as ~100% false
- check multicollinearity if need be for model type espeically with binary columns
- decide what to do with missing values
